                    <p>Hip-hop has long had a special relationship with the debut album — perhaps
                        more so than any other genre. A debut album marks an MC's introduction to
                        the world. It defines their legacy. And, for the most part, it goes down as
                        their most definitive masterwork. For example, Dr. Dre had
                        <em>Chronic.</em>
                        Nas had
                        <em>Illmatic.</em>
                        Jay Z had
                        <em>Reasonable Doubt.</em>
                        Biggie had
                        <em>Ready to Die.</em>
                    </p>

                        <p>Hip-hop's most consistent group started off on a strong note with
                            Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. OutKast's first outing worked in part
                            because Big Boi and Andre 3000 redefined most people's perception of
                            <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/southern-rap-defined-2857310">southern rap.</a>
                            They created an experience that was far more progressive and, ultimately, familiar.
                            They were "two dope boys in a ​Cadillac" with witty rhymes and funk-inspired production.</p>

                        <p>The path to Kanye West's debut, The College Dropout, was paved with great expectations.
                            West shattered every barrier placed in front him, fighting his way through the fire to 
                            deliver one of the best hip-hop albums of all time. The College Dropout's mix of soul,
                            wit, and warmth made it a favorite among hip-hop heads young and old. It was further
                            validated by

                        <p>A Tribe Called Quest's stunning debut appealed to lovers of alternative
                            hip-hop and still resonates today. One highlight you've probably heard
                            is "Bonita Applebum," an ode to a high school shawty which gets bonus points
                            for its safe sex message: "I got crazy prophylactics."</p>

                        <p>One of the most innovative albums of their time, De La Soul's 3
                            Feet High & Rising pushed the boundaries of what was deemed possible
                            in the late 80s/early 90s hip-hop. More than two decades after its release,
                            the group's debut is still enjoyable from start to finish.

                            every sense rap can be remarkable in this age. It's a portrait of thejungle through 
                            the eyes of a prey. And despite a Grammy snub, it was well received by fans, critics and peers.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Dre's solo debut, The Chronic, is one of the most important hip-hop albums ever. 
                            With a young and hungry <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/biography-snoop-dogg-2857175">
                            Snoop Dogg</a> playing his able wing-man, Dre captivated hip-hop with G-funk and

                        <p>Wu-Tang Clan's debut, 36 Chambers, wasn't just a great collection of songs. 
                            It also introduced a number of characters that would go on to reach great 
                            heights individually. Wu's gritty sound, powered by RZA, was the perfect 
                            backdrop for their eccentric storytelling. This album is the number one 
                            reason Wu-Tang is widely considered the

                        <p>Before Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt, mafioso rap lacked nuance but not substance. 
                            Jay studied the game and perfected the template. In addition to meticulously 
                            crafted tales of materialism, he added a vulnerable side that personified 
                            less-than-usual street lords. One of the best albums hip-hop has witnessed yet.</p>

                        <p>Ready to Die is widely acknowledged as a hip-hop masterpiece. 
                            And for good reason. <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/the-notorious-b-i-g-biography-2857168">Biggie's</a> 
                            first outing is a plowed furrow moisturized by visceral tales of survival. The only album released 
                            in Biggie's lifetime is compelling enough to stand up to virtually any hip-hop work of its era. 
                            Ready to Die reached gold within two months, platinum within a year. It also notched a prestigious 
                            4.5 Mic rating in The Source, which praised Biggie's storytelling.

                            is young, hungry and inspired throughout his groundbreaking debut. With his borough, 
                            Queensbridge, as a constant backdrop, Nasty Nas offers vivid stories about blunt heads, 
                            fly ladies and prisoners. Equal parts bleak and hopeful; dark alleys and sun rays. 
                            In the end, Nas created a potent piece of poetry that still endures.</p>
